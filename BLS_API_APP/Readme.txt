Welcome to the BLS API Program!

This program connects to the BLS Public API and graphs unemployment data.

This is a work in progress and is rapdly undergoing development.

The BLS API Program requires Yhat| ggplot for python. Documentation and source code for ggplot can be found at https://github.com/yhat/ggplot/.

About me:
I am a new programmer. I only recently started venturing down the computer science road. This is my first real project. I figured that the best way to learn is to engage the programming community by putting all my new code online as I develop it. Please contact me if you have any suggestions or advice!

Thanks!
